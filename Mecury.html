<p>The smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury,   which is also closest to the Sun <br>.The geological features of Mercury consist of  lobed ridges and impact craters <br>. Being closest to the Sun the Mercuryâ€™s   temperature sores extremely high during the day time <br>.   Mercury can go as high as 450 degree Celsius but surprisingly the nights here are freezing cold.   Mercury has a diameter of 4,878 km and Mercury does not have any natural satellite like Earth.</p>
