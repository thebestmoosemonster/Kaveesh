    <p>Earth is the largest inner planet. It is covered two-third with water.   Earth is the only planet in our solar system where life is possible.   Earthâ€™s atmosphere which is rich in nitrogen and oxygen makes it fit for   the survival of various species of flora and fauna.   However human activities are negatively impacting its atmosphere.   Earth has a diameter of 12,760 km and Earth has one natural satellite   that is the moon.</p>
